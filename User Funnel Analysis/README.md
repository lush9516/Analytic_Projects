# User Funnel Analysis

## General Introduction
This analysis is to evaluate the conversion rate for users in different stages and generate reasonable strategies to help the company increase the conversion rate for different stages.

Technologies used: Clustering, Visualization, Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, etc.

## General Analysis
First, I have aggregated all data into one table then calculate and analyze the conversion rate from a general level. 

Second, I applied KNN clustering to divide all users into three clusters and conduct analysis on conversion rate for each cluster. My analysis has revealed the difference between different clusters, proposed possible reasons for those difference and come up with corresponding strategies for different clusters.

## Analysis on Different Clusters
For Cluster 1: All users are male who are using the apps on PC; Cluster 2: All users are female who are using ths apps on mobile; 52% of the users are male and 74% of them are using mobile app.

As I have found out, the conversion rate from search to payment and from payment to confirmation in cluster 3 is clearly higher than other two clusters. This means that for the female users who are using PC, they are more likely to move from search to final payments. The company can take this into consideration when designing more promotion campaigns in the future.

## Recommendations and Insights
From the data I have, I've noticed a very strange thing that the conversion rate from payment page to confirmation page is very low, which is not reasonable. Normally, we may assume that the all the users go to payment page should be interested in this product. This phenomenon means that the company should pay much attention to the final page and payment degisn since there might be something wrong that prevent the users from completing the payments.
