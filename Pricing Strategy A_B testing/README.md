# Pricing Strategy for A/B Testing

## General Introduction
This project is my analysis on the results of A/B testing on pricing strategy. Customers in control and experiment will receive different price for the product and my analysis can help the company to come up with the optimized price strategy to maximize the profits.

## Analysis Process
First, I have conduct some analysi on the user's profiles to see that whether they are randomly assigned and comparable between control and experiment groups.

Then I have broken down all the users in to different segementations, such as by operative system, source and location, etc.

Through the above analysis, I have found out that for different segementations of users, their sensitiviti to price is different. And I've made proper recommendations based on the findings.

## Analysis Results
The conversion rate for purchase in control group is 1.9% while it's 1.5% in test group. But when taking price into consideration, the test group can actually generate more revenue (17% higher than control group)
