# COVID-19 Analysis
## General Introduction
This project is my analysis on the current COVID-19 analysis.
It mainly includes the several parts:
1) Compare the COVID-19 trends between  New York and Hubei
2) Compare the COVID-19 trends between U.S and Italy.

## Data Collection and Cleaning
I have built an automated pipeline to aggregate the latest data from [JHU CSSE daily report](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports).
For further analysis, I choosed the data from the day that there is more than 100 confirmed cases (sign of begining of COVID-19 in this area).

## Comparison between New York and Hubei
From my analysis, I have found out that the confirmed cases trends in NY is similar to the one in Hubei.
The issue is that, for Hubei things have been under control quite fast under hitting the peak while the the incremental trends in NY still stays in a relative high level after hitting the peak.

## Comparison between US and Italy
Generally speaking, the COVID-19 virus situations in US is worse than the ones in Italy.
In the most recent days, new confirmed cases for each day in Italy almost stays at the 5000-level while it keep increasing in US from 5000 to 30000.

This also holds true for new deaths cases, for Italy it stays around 750 while this number in US keep increasing from almost 0 to 2000 without any signs of stoping or even stabling.
