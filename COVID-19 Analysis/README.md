## General Introduction
This project is my analysis on the current COVID-19 analysis.
It mainly includes the several parts:
1) Compare the COVID-19 trends between  New York and Wu Han
2) Compare the COVID-18 trends between U.S. Italy and China.

## Comparison between New York and Wuhan
From my analysis, I have found out that the confirmed cases trends in NY is similar to the one in Wuhan.



## Comparison between US and Italy
Generally speaking, the COVID-19 virus situations in US is worse than the ones in Italy.
In the most recent days, new confirmed cases for each day in Italy almost stays at the 5000-level while it keep increasing in US from 5000 to 30000.

This also holds true for new deaths cases, for Italy it stays around 750 while this number in US keep increasing from almost 0 to 2000 without any signs of stoping or even stabling.
