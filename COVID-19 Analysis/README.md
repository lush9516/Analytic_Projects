## Analysis on General Trends in US
First, I have conduct some analysi on the user's profiles to see that whether they are randomly assigned and comparable between control and experiment groups.

Then I have broken down all the users in to different segementations, such as by operative system, source and location, etc.

Through the above analysis, I have found out that for different segementations of users, their sensitiviti to price is different. And I've made proper recommendations based on the findings.
