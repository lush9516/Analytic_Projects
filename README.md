# Analytic_Projects
This is a record of my analytical projects including Experiments design(A/B testing), data analysis, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For Experiments design, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib.pyplot` packages are required.

For Data Analysis, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `sklearn` packages are required.

#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```
### General guidance

For Data Manipulation, there are practices about rewriting SQL queries in python, data manipulation using pandas and data manipulation using numpy.

For Data Visualization, there are practices about visualization using `matplotlib.pyplt` and `seaborn`.
